# Encrypter-Decrypter
## Text Encrypter / Decrypter

This project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple text encryption and decryption tool that manipulates text based on the following rules:

- The letter "e" is replaced with "enter"
- The letter "i" is replaced with "imes"
- The letter "a" is replaced with "ai"
- The letter "o" is replaced with "ober"
- The letter "u" is replaced with "ufat"

Users will have the capability to both encrypt and decrypt messages using these rules.

### Examples:
- Encrypting "gato" results in "gaitober".
- Decrypting "gaitober" results in "gato".
